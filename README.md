# Conundrum-Solver
A quick and easy script to find the solution to any conundrum from the popular British TV show: "8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown".

Simply run the script, and run the function *find_solution(conundrum,num_solutions)*, which does the following:
  -imports *all* english words from the unlicensed word library <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/LICENSE.md"> here </a>
  -finds number of possible solutions to the conundrum, ordered in descending order by length (max points)
